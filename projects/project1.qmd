## Overview  
This project predicts **Uber ride fares** using a **Gradient Boosting Model (XGBoost)**. The model leverages **pickup/dropoff locations, distance, and passenger count** to estimate fares accurately.

## Methodology  
- **Dataset:** 200,000 Uber ride records with fare amounts  
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated ride distance using latitude/longitude  
- **Modeling:** Trained **XGBoost Regression** with hyperparameter tuning  

## Key Findings  
- **Distance is the strongest predictor** of fare amount  
- **Time-based features (hour, day of the week) also impact fares**  
- **XGBoost outperformed Linear Regression** in prediction accuracy  

## Results Visualization

## Conclusion  
This model demonstrates how **machine learning can optimize fare predictions**, with potential applications in **dynamic pricing strategies**.
