## Overview  
This study examines how **classical and heavy metal music** influence reading comprehension. Using an **ANOVA analysis within a Randomized Block Design (RCBD)**, we tested whether music genre affects performance on a standardized reading test.

## Methodology  
- **Participants:** 60 participants randomly assigned to classical or heavy metal conditions  
- **Design:** Pretest-Posttest with **Randomized Block Design (RCBD)**  
- **Analysis:** ANOVA to compare reading scores across conditions  

## Key Findings  
- **Classical music group** scored significantly higher on reading comprehension.  
- **Heavy metal music** had a small negative effect, but not statistically significant.  
- **RCBD controlled for prior reading ability**, improving statistical power.

## Conclusion  
Our findings suggest that **classical music may enhance reading comprehension**, while heavy metal has no strong negative effect. Future research could explore **music tempo, lyrics, or individual differences**.
