## Overview  
This project predicts **NBA game outcomes** using **Logistic Regression with L2 regularization (Ridge penalty)**. The model analyzes **team and player statistics** to determine the probability of a win or loss.

## Methodology  
- **Dataset:** Historical NBA game data with **team stats (shooting %, turnovers, rebounds, assists, etc.)**  
- **Feature Engineering:** Scaled continuous variables and selected the most important predictors  
- **Modeling:** Implemented **Logistic Regression with L2 penalty (Ridge Regularization)** for better generalization  
- **Evaluation:** Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to assess performance  

## Key Findings  
- **Logistic Regression with L2 regularization outperformed other models**  
- **Turnovers, shooting %, and rebounds were the strongest predictors**  
- **Regularization reduced overfitting, improving model stability**  

## Results Visualization

## Conclusion  
L2-penalized Logistic Regression provides a **stable and interpretable model** for predicting NBA game outcomes. Future work could explore **player-specific metrics, momentum analysis, and real-time in-game factors**.
