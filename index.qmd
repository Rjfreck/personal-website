## About Me

Hey, I’m Rory Freck, and I’m passionate about the intersection of finance, data, and problem-solving. I’m currently finishing up my degree in Statistics and Data Science at UCLA, where I’ve spent the last few years studying statistical theory, data applications, and machine learning. This fall, I’ll be starting my Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAcc) at CSUN where I will hope to start my career in public auditing.

I’ve had the chance to work as a Data Analyst Intern at Stanford, where I built interactive dashboards in Tableau, analyzed hiring trends, and created an employee recognition webpage using Drupal and HTML/CSS. Before that, I interned at Stony Apparel Corp., where I helped with data integrity, client orders, and data verification; ultimately, leading to the prevention of a $5,000 compliance fee through careful verification.

Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing golf and talking baseball. I am always looking to learn, connect, and develop professionally, so feel free to connect on LinkedIn!
