## Overview

This study investigates how **demographic, socioeconomic, and psychological factors** contribute to depression risk in the United States. Using **logistic regression and random forest models**, we analyze data from the **National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)** to uncover key predictors of depression.

## Methodology

- **Dataset:** 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
- **Sample Size:** 28,260 U.S. adults
- **Predictors Explored:** Race, education, income-to-poverty ratio, anxiety screening, disability, and discrimination experiences.
- **Statistical Methods:**
  - Logistic Regression (to estimate depression risk)
  - Random Forest (to assess variable importance)
  - Chi-Squared Tests (to examine categorical associations)
  - K-Fold Cross Validation (to validate model performance)

## Key Findings

- **Anxiety screening was the strongest predictor** of depression risk.
- **Disability status** significantly increased the odds of depression.
- **Experiences of discrimination**, such as feeling disrespected or threatened, had a strong association with depression.
- **Lower socioeconomic status** (income-to-poverty ratio) was linked to higher depression risk.

## Conclusion  
Our findings indicate that **mental health disparities** are influenced by **economic, psychological, and social factors**. Policies aimed at improving financial stability, reducing discrimination, and expanding mental health care access could mitigate depression risk.
